Super simple example of using the accounts-ui and accounts-twitter login feature of MeteorJS to scaffold a user login-0Auth and display registration for an event . 

Example code will display a Twitter account avatar image, their screen_name, a user centric @mention button, @follow button and Tweetdeck Collection (not really connected but I wanted to see what a collection could do in bootstrap)
